~## Objective:
Your task is to create and execute test cases for testing the login functionality of a web application using Cypress.

## Instructions:
1. Download and install Node JS from [here](https://nodejs.org).
2. Clone / download the this GitHub repository
3. Run `npm install` and start the node server using `node index.js`.
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to access the login page.

   The correct login credentials are:
   - Username: admin
   - Password: 123456

5. Set up Cypress to run tests against the provided login page.
6. Create test cases to validate the login functionality based on the following scenarios:
   - Positive test case: Should login successfully with valid credentials.
   - Negative test case: Should display error message when login with invalid credentials.
   - Boundary test case: Should display error message when login with empty credentials.
7. Write clear and concise test scripts using Cypress' syntax.
8. Execute the test cases and ensure they pass or fail as expected.

## Submission:
Please submit your Cypress test scripts along with the test report to your GitHub/GitLab repository. Ensure that your submission includes clear instructions on how to run the tests.

**Note:** You are encouraged to explore additional test scenarios beyond the ones listed above to demonstrate your testing skills.

## Testing Instruction:
In this repo there are test cases for testing the e2e login functionality using cypress. The test cases are in the cypress folder-> e2e -> login.cy.test.

To run the test, open a terminal and type :
1. `npm install`
2. `node index.js`
